This is especially useful for people with visual impairments to use common cards in an inclusive way. In fact, Card Detector in addition to recognizing playing cards has text-to-speech functionality that plays the name of the recognized card.

The image classification model was created using TensorFlow lite, with a proprietary image dataset.

Feel free to reuse the code or improve it in any way.
